Preventing relapse requires a commitment to recovery. It also requires a plan of action. 
Relapse is not an event, but a process. Before the physical act of relapse, there are 
changes in feelings, thoughts, and behaviiors. Cravings also play a role in relapse. 
By developing and following a written plan, you can halt the relapse process.
